# Personal-Beginner-Python-ML-Notebook-Before-College
<h3> This is Duke Anh's Before-University Python Notebooks </h3>
This is a git that compiles all of my jupyter notebook files that contains some random python syntax and ML principles that i learned throughout my highschool

<p> This is where I aggregate my Python self-learning journey, this miscellaneous bunch of .ipynd files might be chaotic, but I haven't had any proper education or personal mentorship, all was studied by pure interests. I will be attending the University of Michigan -- Ann Arbor as an Data Science major next year on 2025 so, until the August of 2025, this would still be here but not active as before.</p>

<p> I'm currently talking to myself right now, but I hope in the future someone's gonna find this Git and kind of know where I left off and witness my growth</p>

To be honest, I was inspired by this picture, though this README may be noted as fixed, but I just forgot to share this picture.... anyhow, I still wanted to share here. 

And thus, these files' contents are somewhat adhered to the content in this picture.
